## My process

I was going to go with SCSS to practice but decided to go with pure CSS. 

I solved this in around 2hs and measuring the sizes by eye, so it might need several improvements.

Also thought of showing the `attribution` div in the bottom but I'm keeping it hidden to make the solution match the design.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### Useful resources

- [CSS Conventions](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/css-naming-conventions-that-will-save-you-hours-of-debugging-35cea737d849/) - I consulted this to use the BEM naming convention correctly.
